# Network Installer Prerequisites

## Apparently, the latest version of Clover doesn't inject Etherent kexts \(which is needed for network installer\). Make an [Offline Installer](offline-installer-prerequisites.md) instead!!!

## ~~Network Installer Prerequisites~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~You'll need to have **LAN \(Ethernet\) connection** if you are making a **Network Installer**. If you do _**NOT**_ have, please make an~~ [~~**Offline Installer**~~](offline-installer-prerequisites.md) ~~instead.~~
{% endhint %}

### ~~General~~

* ~~You **MUST** have fast Internet Speed \(at least 20 Mbps\). If your Internet Speed is slow, make an Offline Installer instead as the Installer might be locked while installing.~~

### ~~Preparation for making an Offline Installer from macOS~~

* ~~~~[~~Clover install package~~](https://cloverdb.com) ~~\(Get the latest and remember the version\)~~
* ~~~~[~~Clover Configurator~~](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) ~~\(for editing the config\)~~

### ~~Preparation for making an Network Installer from Windows~~

* ~~~~[~~Clover Cloud Editor~~](http://cloudclovereditor.altervista.org/cce/index.php) ~~\(You'll need this site later for making you config.plist\)~~
